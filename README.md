# Gilded Rose Kata Refactoring Challenge

This challenge is a popular refactoring exercise among developers.

The code starts as a mess and the challenge is to implement best practices and make the code more readable.

During this challenge, my process was to analyse the functionality of the code and refactor small parts.

I noticed that there were some repeated conditionals so I separated this functionality into its methods.

This challenge also involves writing unit tests to ensure that any changes made to the code do not affect its functionality.
